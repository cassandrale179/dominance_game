# dominance_game
Phaser.io game to test social dominance based on brain circuit stimulation 


## Introduction  
- Researchers have identified a neural circuit in the brains of mice that plays a role in social dominance. Stimulating the neurons in this circuit significantly boosted a mouse's chance of becoming the "winner" during aggressive encounters with other mice 
- The dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) has been implicated in the long-term regulation of social dominance, yet the exact mechanism behind the "winner effect" remains unknown. 
- To investigate social competition in laboratory mice, we applied the dominance tube test, which is highly transitive and stable and correlates well with other dominance measures  
- The purpose of this repo is to recreated a similar game simulation using Phaser.io, but instead of mices, we want to test on human subjects.
